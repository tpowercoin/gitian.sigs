# gitian.sigs

This repository contains gitian signatures for TPWR. It should be updated on each release.

### How to Make and Submit Gitian Sigs

See the release process in the TPWR-coin repository on how to build the release archives to create gitian sigs. 
This can be found in doc/release-process.md. 
Be sure to use the release process of the **tag that you're building!**

Instructions for setting up a gitian build environment can also be found there.
